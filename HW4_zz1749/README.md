## Assignment 2

In this assignment, I worked with Chenrui Zhang and Hongkai He and I was in charge of the MANOVA test.

## FBB 
### MANOVA: confusing: IV and DV are swapped. IV is the performance level, DV is the biometrics and test performance.The question as formulated I am not sure I understand it, but from the paper it is "are the youth tests predictors of performance in adult age?" and the H0 that the tests for all APL (performance group levels) will be the same
## otherwise ok (though the nulls could be simplified in the other tests

Thanks for the help of Yukun Wan(yw3447), she helped me with the geometry library which could filter data starting from MN and BK, even though at last I did not use this function cuz it would take 8 hours to process, but it's a very simple and viable way.
