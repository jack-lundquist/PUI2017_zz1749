## Citibike Analysis
- All done by myself
- I created a null hypothesis: The ratio of man biking at morning (5 am to 12 am as the interval between sunrise and noon) over man biking the whole day is the same or higher than the ratio of woman biking at morning over woman biking the whole day, and test it with Z-test using Citibike 201706 public datasets in iPython Notebook
- After analysis, I composed a scientific paper on what I've done and what I've got.

## Assignment 2: SQL Lab
